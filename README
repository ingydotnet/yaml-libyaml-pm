NAME
    YAML::XS - Perl YAML Serialization using XS and libyaml

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::XS;

        my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
        my $array = Load $yaml;

DESCRIPTION
    Kirill Siminov's "libyaml" is arguably the best YAML implementation. The
    C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was
    originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

    This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl the best
    YAML support to date.

    This module exports the functions "Dump", "Load", "DumpFile" and
    "LoadFile". These functions are intended to work exactly like
    "YAML.pm"'s corresponding functions.

CONFIGURATION
    $YAML::XS::UseCode
    $YAML::XS::DumpCode
    $YAML::XS::LoadCode
        If enabled supports deparsing and evaling of code blocks.

    $YAML::XS::QuoteNumericStrings
        When true (the default) strings that look like numbers but have not
        been numified will be quoted when dumping.

        This ensures leading that things like leading zeros and other
        formatting are preserved.

USING YAML::XS WITH UNICODE
    Handling unicode properly in Perl can be a pain. YAML::XS only deals
    with streams of utf8 octets. Just remember this:

        $perl = Load($utf8_octets);
        $utf8_octets = Dump($perl);

    There are many, many places where things can go wrong with unicode. If
    you are having problems, use Devel::Peek on all the possible data
    points.
